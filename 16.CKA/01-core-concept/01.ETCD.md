- ### When you setup kubeadm

  - it setup etcd server as pods   

  - kubectl  get pods -n kube-system

    ```bash
    # how to get all keys of etcd cluster
    $ kubectl exec etcd-master -n kube-system etcdl get / --prefix -keys-only
    ```

- ### IN HA etcd

  - we set configuration so that they can communicate with each other in **`ectd.service`**

- ### How to install etcd and operation

  ```bash
  # install binaries
  $ 
  # extract
  $
  # run etcd
  $ ./etcd
  # store data in etcd with etcdl with version v2 & v3
  $ ./etcdctl set "name" "worker1"
  $ ./etcdctl put "name" "worker2"
  # get value from etcd
  $ ./etcdctl get key1
  # to see more option about etcd
  $ ./etcdctl
  # to check etcdl client version and api version
  $ ./etcdctl --version
  # to change api version of etcdctl
  $ EDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl version
  # to change api version of etcdctl with enviromental variable
  $ export EDCTL_API=3
  $ ./etcdctl version
  
  ```

  ### URL
   **--adevertise-client-url-https** should be configured in kube-api server 
** kubeadm deploy etcd as pod and you can check it**
```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system

```  
**etcdctl version 3 commands**
```bash
$ etcdctl snapshot save
$ etcdctl endpoint health
$ etcdctl get
$ etcdctl put
$ export ETCDCTL_API=3
```
